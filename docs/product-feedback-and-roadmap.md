Import screen:
1. Required fields are listed down at the bottom next to the import button. This is wild. It should be probably right above the file preview or somewhere else visible. Also, remove "Required: Date, Amount, Description, Account." from the top of the Mapping section (not a good place for it).
2. Currently we use a unstyled built-in browser select list for upping the columns. It looks absolutely ugly. Instead, we should be using a similar drop-down, like filters on the analysis screen or filters on the rules screen. Also, once the column is mapped, it should be tastefully highlighted for immediate visual feedback.
3. `amountHintForMapping` look funky in the chip. Think of some better, more tasteful way to display the hint.
3. Right now, if I import the same file twice, the transactions will be duplicated. This is bad. If the user imports the same file twice, we should ask the user whether they want to proceed and overwrite the transactions or cancel the input. But we need to be careful because in a single file, the user can have transactions from multiple months the first time. If the first time they import the first months and the second time they import the second month, we shouldn't warn because there is no duplication. So only in the case where they import the same months on the same file second time, we should ask whether to overwrite or cancel.
