## Frontend Rules You MUST Follow

- Always read `./tailwind.config.js` when creating or editing UI components to ensure consistency (colors, fonts, shadows, animations, etc.).
- Check types with `make typescript` after editing .ts, .tsx files.
- Wails Event Pattern (for Go → Frontend communication):
    - When Go needs to trigger UI state (e.g., open modal, show dialog), use `runtime.EventsEmit(ctx, "event-name")` in Go
    - In React, import `EventsOn` from `wailsjs/runtime/runtime` and set up listener: `const off = EventsOn('event-name', callback)`
    - Always clean up event listeners in useEffect cleanup: `return () => off?.()`
    - Example: `ShowAbout()` in app.go emits "show-about" event, App.tsx listens and shows About modal
- Use "Owner" (corresponds to `owner_name` in DB).
- Visual Stability & Motion:
    - Use Optimistic Updates for data changes. Never trigger a global loading state that unmounts the list.
    - Use `framer-motion` (`layout` prop) to animate items moving and `AnimatePresence` (mode="popLayout") for items appearing/disappearing to prevent layout jumps.
    - Subtle Animations: Prefer subtle (4-8px) vertical offsets and simple `easeOut` or high-damping springs for a professional, purposeful feel. Avoid scaling on exit.
    - Success Feedback: Provide immediate in-place feedback (e.g., success flash on a tag) after a save, while syncing the backend in the background.
- Typography & Casing:
    - Use `text-canvas-600` and `uppercase` for small labels/metadata (e.g. table headers like DATE, OWNER) to ensure readability.
    - No Caps for Data Names: Do NOT use `uppercase` for actual names. Use normal sentence or title casing.
- Finance Formatting: When rendering negative currency amounts, never show the minus sign. Use the absolute value and indicate the negative state using red text (e.g., `text-finance-expense`).
- Use React Portals (`createPortal`) for suggestions/dropdowns to prevent clipping by `overflow-hidden` or causing unwanted height changes.
- Snappy Multi-selects: All dropdown filters with >5 items MUST include:
    - Search input (auto-focused on open)
    - "Select All" / "Deselect All" bulk toggles
    - "ONLY" button on item hover to quickly isolate a single selection
    - Clear typography showing current selection count (or "All selected")
- All external links MUST use Wails' `BrowserOpenURL` from `wailsjs/runtime/runtime`, not `window.open()` or `<a>` tags with `href`.
    - Import: `import { BrowserOpenURL } from '<path>/wailsjs/runtime/runtime'`
    - Usage: `onClick={() => BrowserOpenURL('https://example.com')}`
